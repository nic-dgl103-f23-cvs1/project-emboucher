        <p>
          You might visit us to enjoy the music, but have you ever considered
          playing it? We are always looking for passionate local musicians to
          promote at our markets and we are so lucky to have such great talent
          here on Vancouver Island.

        <p>
          If you haven't been to the CVFM yet, let me tell you, you don't even
          know what you're missing out on yet! Our vendors travel from both far
          and near (but mostly near) to sell their crafted products to you. With
          such a variety, how could you not shop local? From lettuce to lemon
          lattice, we've got you covered.
